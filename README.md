# Kevin's Dot Files
These are config files to configure a system awesomely.

## Installation
`git clone git@github.com:krohrbaugh/dotfiles.git ~/bin/dotfiles
cd ~/bin/dotfiles/home
cp bash_profile ~/.bash_profile
cp bashrc ~/.bashrc`

_Note:_ The bash prompt uses [vcprompt](http://vc.gerg.ca/hg/vcprompt) to display version control information for
CVS, Git and Mercurial. This should be built and installed somewhere on the `$PATH`.

## Environment
I am running on Mac OS X, currently 10.6, Snow Leopard, using bash as my shell.
