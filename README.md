# Kevin Rohrbaugh Dot Files
These are config files to configure a system how I like. I'm a Unix noob, so it's nothing special.

## Installation

    git clone git@github.com:krohrbaugh/dotfiles.git ~/bin/dotfiles
    cd ~/bin/dotfiles/
    rake install

_Note:_ The bash prompt uses [vcprompt](http://vc.gerg.ca/hg/vcprompt) to display version control information for
CVS, Git and Mercurial. This should be built and installed somewhere on the `$PATH` (typically `~/bin`).

## Environment
I am running on Mac OS X, currently 10.6, Snow Leopard, using bash as my shell.

## Credits

Many of the files are based on, if not exact duplicates of, [Ryan Bates' dotfiles](http://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles/).
